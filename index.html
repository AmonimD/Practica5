								<h2>The First-Timer’s<br />
									Lisbon Travel Guide</h2>
								<p>Lisbon is one of the prettiest and most liveable cities we’ve been to thus far. I used to live in San Francisco in the late 90s and that’s exactly what Lisbon felt like to me. It’s beautiful, it’s hilly, it’s got that same artsy vibe, and it’s home to some amazing food, both Portuguese and international. It’s one of those cities that makes you feel good simply by being there.<br />
								   With so much going for it, it’s no surprise that Lisbon has been one of the most talked about European destinations in recent memory. If you’ve heard the buzz and want to see what all the fuss is about, then this detailed travel guide will tell you all you need to know to plan your first trip to Lisbon.</p>

								<h2>Castelo de São Jorge</h2>
								<p>The most recognized of Lisbon's major attractions, St. George's Castle commands a glorious position near Alfama on the crown of a hill overlooking the Portuguese capital.
								   This is one of Lisbon's most popular tourist destinations. Its impressive battlements, engaging museum, and fascinating archaeological site combine to make the castle a rewarding experience for the whole family, and kids especially will love clambering over the sturdy walls and towers that encircle the grounds.</p>

								<h2>Mosteiro dos Jerónimos<br />
									Built in Honor of Portugal's Age of Discovery</h2>
								<p>A highlight of any Lisbon sightseeing tour, the 16th-century Jerónimos monastery is one of the great landmarks of Portugal, a stunning monument of immense historic and cultural significance deserving of its UNESCO World Heritage Site accolade.
								   Near the riverfront in Lisbon's attractive Belém neighborhood, the monastery, also known as the Hieronymite convent, was commissioned by King Manuel I in 1501. Built to honor Vasco da Gama's epic 1498 voyage to India, Jerónimos is as much a symbol of the wealth of the Age of Discovery as it is a house of worship (construction was mostly funded by trade in the spices brought back by da Gama).</p>

								<h2>Museu Calouste Gulbenkian<br />
									A Priceless Collection of Western and Eastern Art</h2>
								<p>A sparkling gem in Lisbon's cultural crown, the Museu Calouste Gulbenkian is also one of the most celebrated museums in Europe. The facility, sited in a lush, verdant park in the north of the city, is named after Calouste Sarkis Gulbenkian, an Armenian oil magnate born in 1869, who bequeathed his vast private art collection to Portugal shortly before his death in 1955. Following the terms of this endowment a foundation was created, the centerpiece of which is this purpose-built arts complex.</p>
