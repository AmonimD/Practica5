								<p>Lisbon is one of the oldest cities in western Europe. After the region was settled by the Celts, it was then founded by the Phoenicians. They established a settlement called Ulissipo, which was then conquered by the Greeks and Carthaginians. In 205 BC, the Romans won the Second Punic War against the Carthaginians and occupied the city, calling it Olissipo. Ancient Lisbon was integrated into the Roman province of Lusitania, but when the Roman Empire collapsed, it was invaded by Germanic tribes and was controlled by the Kingdom of the Suebi until 585.</p>

								<h3>Muslim period and Lisbon’s reconquest</h3>
								<p>In 711, the Islamic Moors invaded the Peninsula, including Lisbon. They renamed the city al-Usbuma. In 789, Alfonso II of Asturias managed to reconquer the city until 808. Finally, the Christians retook the city in 1147, led by Afonso I and supported by a fleet of the second crusade.
									During the reign of Afonso III, Lisbon became the base for Portugal’s maritime expansion. This contributed to the development of the maritime laws enacted by King Ferdinand I. Afonso III also moved the capital from Coimbra to Lisbon.
									At the end of the fourteenth century, the merchant oligarchy enthroned the House of Aviz (the second dynasty of kings in Portugal) and under their reign, the city began to flourish.

								<h4>Lisbon during the Renaissance</h4>
								<p>From the fifteenth century onwards, the port of Lisbon became one of the most important in the world. During this period, the Casa da Guiné e Mina (a group of warehouses and customs offices) was established in the capital. This organisation managed all aspects of overseas trade giving the city great power. Lisbon centralized commerce with the Cape Verde coast.
									The city’s wealth attracted numerous citizens from Genoa, Flanders and Mallorca. Their maritime knowledge influenced the court of Henry the Navigator.
									In the sixteenth century, the Casa da India began to conduct business with Asia, Africa and Brazil, making the city yet wealthier, and the most important slave trade centre in Europe.
